# **`online-portfolio`**

## **`Overview`**
This repository contains the source code used to create my [online portfolio](stevenott.surge.sh).

## **`Components / Host`**
The webpage was built using [Bootstrap v5.0.2](https://getbootstrap.com/) and is published using [Surge](https://surge.sh/).

## **`Goals`**
1. Add light/dark theme switcher
    - Add the component to the content or menu of the page
    - Create dark-theme.css and light-theme.css to specify the appearance of each theme
    - Create a js method that will switch the current theme to the other
    - Add local storage so the browser remembers a user's choice
2. Create a page to display interesting projects
    - Create a useful menu bar to switch between the pages
    - Use bootstrap to create cards for different projects
    - Maintain the page usability through project changes
